I am a part time graduate student at Upenn MCIT program. In this summer, I took CIT591 - Introduction to Software Development course in which we created a Java based app as final team project.

We built a tool that is designed to compare public companies reported earnings and consensus estimate and present a direct visualization to user. Users of our tool can utilize the data points analysis to make investment decisions. This tool can also be used by financial statement preparer to verify the alignment of quarterly earnings.

Take a look of our demo video

Check out our [git repository](https://github.com/HX765/EarningBeats) for the source code.
